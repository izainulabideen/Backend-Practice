# Backend with Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB

This repository contains the backend codebase for a web application built with Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB. This backend serves as the server-side logic and handles data storage and retrieval using MongoDB.

## Prerequisites
- Node.js installed on your machine. You can download it [here](https://nodejs.org/).
- MongoDB installed and running locally or a connection to a remote MongoDB database.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/izainulabideen/Backend-Practice.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd backend-project-folder
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

4. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following content:

```env
PORT=3000
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/your-database-name
```

Replace the MongoDB URI with your specific configuration.

5. Start the server:

```bash
npm start
```

The server will run on `http://localhost:3000` by default, but you can change the `PORT` variable in the `.env` file.

## Basic Project Structure

```

├── models               # Define MongoDB data models and schemas
├── routes               # Define application routes and associated controllers
├── middleware           # Custom middleware functions
├── config               # Configuration files (e.g., database connection)
├── utils                # Utility functions and helpers
├── app.js               # Main application file
